abstract = {Abstract The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is a dynamic, electronically insulating film that forms on the negative electrode of Li+ batteries (LIBs) and enables ion movement to/from the interface while preventing electrolyte breakdown. However, there is limited comparative understanding of LIB SEIs with respect to those formed on Na+ and K+ electrolytes for emerging battery concepts. We used scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for the in situ interfacial analysis of incipient SEIs in Li+, K+ and Na+ electrolytes formed on multi-layer graphene. Feedback images using 300 nm SECM probes and ion-sensitive measurements indicated a superior passivation and highest cation flux for a Li+-SEI in contrast to Na+ and K+-SEIs. Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated significant fluoride formation for only Li+ and Na+-SEIs, enabling correlation to in situ SECM measurements. While SEI chemistry remains complex, these electroanalytical methods reveal links between chemical variables and the interfacial properties of materials for energy storage.},
