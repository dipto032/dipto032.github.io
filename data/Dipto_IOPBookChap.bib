abstract = {Dr Rodgiguez Joaquin et al describe an emerging technique of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for understanding the complex processes and performance of materials within batteries. SECM utilizes a small electrode probe to map and quantify localized electrochemical phenomena over a sample surface and provide in situ information on each major component in a typical battery—anode, cathode, electrolyte, and the separator. The power of SECM lies in its ability to study ion and electron transfer—both of which are the fundamental processes driving all batteries. Further, SECM provides insight on the complex interfacial electrochemistry that occurs within battery systems at length scales ranging from μm to nm. For instance, this dynamic range is particularly useful in exploring the formation and progression of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI), which is critical to the safe operation of Li-ion batteries.},
